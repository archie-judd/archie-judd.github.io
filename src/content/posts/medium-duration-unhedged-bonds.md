What follows is the inaugral annual investment ramble as part of my five year (likely longer [possibly shorter!]) plan to buy a house. This isn't advice, I don't know what I'm talking about, I am just organising my inexpert thoughts and I won't make a habit of it.

### US Equities are expensive

The seven largest tech stocks of the S&P 500 make up 34.4% of its total market cap. This is unusual (but not without precedent) - their forward price-earnings ratio average roughly 25-35X (historically the S&P 500 trades at 15-18X). So significant revenue growth is already priced in.

The Buffet Indicator (Total US Market Capitalisation to US GDP) crossed 200% in 2021, a threshold he described if crossed as "playing with fire". It is now 230%, meaning stock market value has been growing much faster than the actual economy. Stocks compose a greater portion of U.S. household wealth than real estate.

Additionally, the largest tech stocks are responsible for both the majority of supply (Nvidia) and demand (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta) of AI infrastructure spending, resulting in a situation whereby:

1. Nvidia sells chips to hyperscalers (Google, Microsoft, Amazon)
2. They report huge AI capex (which impresses investors)
3. Nvidia reports massive revenue
4. Everyone's valuation goes up
5. Repeat.

This is occurring off the back of massive expected growth in end-user revenue from revenue streams and business models that are still being developed (and experimented - Microsoft has struggled to monetise copilot, for example).

Furthermore, Michael Burry has also warned hyperscalers are using aggressive accounting practices - specifically very optimistic hardware depreciation rates - to artificially boost earnings. They are buying AI chips and servers with an expected lifespan of 2-3 years and assuming they will depreciated over 5-6 years.

All this points to US equities being extremely expensive, and a correction of some sort being likely over the next two years.

### Gold is expensive

This time last year, equities also looked expensive. A load of other people probably thought so too, they thought gold would be a good bet, and the price rose 70% in 2025. It rose the same amount in the 20 years prior to Gordon Brown selling the gold reserves.

This price rise has largely been driven by central banks buying and geopolitical uncertainty. The American banks seem to think gold has further to rise in 2026. But it seems pretty expensive to me.

### Government Bonds seem sensible

With inflation falling over 2025, central banks lowered interest rates. In the UK, interest rates fell from 4.75% to 3.75%. The same pattern is predicted in 2025 meaning money market fund returns are likely to drop further.

Many tech companies have taken on substantial debt to fund AI infrastructure. If AI revenue growth doesn't meet (high) expectations, servicing that debt may become difficult, which will affect corporate bond markets negatively.

However, assuming interest rates keep falling, government bonds may increase in value, particularly medium and long duration. If inflation remains sticky, interest rates may remain high, and bonds prices may stagnate. I think short-duration government bonds represent the safest risk-mitigation investment, and medium-long duration government bonds could do quite well in the event of a recession and or interest rate reduction.

### And Unhedged Government Bonds represent opportunity

Unhedged government bonds return in their base currency (usually USD). So investors take the risk (or reward) resulting from any currency fluctuation between GBP and USD between the time they buy and sell. If the AI boom continues, capital will keep flowing into US equities and corporate bonds, strengthening the dollar, and if the AI bubble pops, the money is likely to flow into the US, because of US bonds' safe-haven quality. I don't know what'll happen to GBP. In a global recession GBP tends to weaken against USD which is good (if you hold unhedged government bonds).

With regards to duration, longer-duration bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes, short-duration bonds much less so. If interest rates fall, medium and long duration bonds are likely to do very well. If inflation remains sticky and interest rates don't fall (or rise), they are likely to do very poorly. Inflation in the US is forecast to remain sticky in the first half of 2026, and likely to fall towards the 2% target in the latter half of 2026, and into 2027. If the AI bubble pops, the effect will be disinflationary, or even deflationary.

So, there are multiple scenarios where medium duration unhedged government bonds pay off, and the more of these happen, the better they pay off:

1. Inflation falls (likely)
2. USD strengthens against GBP (possible)
3. Recession, or AI bubble pops (possible)

And some scenarios where they don't:

1. Inflations remains high (possible)
2. GBP strengthens against USD (uncertain)

I think that makes medium duration unhedged government bonds a compelling equity-bubble mitigation alternative (or complement) to short-term GBP hedged bonds.
